This system is designed to detect anomalous behavior in financial transactions by monitoring for deviations from KYC (Know Your Customer) declarations. It identifies instances where transaction volumes exceed the declared limits or involve unexpected countries, flagging potential risks or inconsistencies for further investigation. By leveraging advanced analytics, the system ensures compliance with regulatory standards and enhances security by promptly highlighting suspicious activities that diverge from anticipated transaction patterns.
