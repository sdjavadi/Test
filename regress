1. 🔼 Slope (how fast the values are changing)

To compute the slope:

First, calculate the average (mean) of all x values (months) and all y values (transaction amounts).

Then, for each month:

Subtract the average from both x and y to get the "deviation" from the mean.

Multiply these deviations together.

Sum all those products from step 2.

Divide that sum by the sum of the squared x deviations (how spread out the months are).

👉 The result is the slope — how much the metric increases (or decreases) per month on average.

2. 🚦 Intercept (starting point of the line)

Once you have the slope:

Multiply the slope by the average x value.

Subtract that from the average y value.

👉 The result is the intercept — the estimated value of the metric at the start (month index 0).

So now you have the full equation:

predicted value = slope × month_index + intercept

3. 📏 R² Score (how well the line fits the data)

R² tells you how closely the actual data points follow the trend line.

For each month:

Calculate the predicted y value using the trend line.

Subtract that from the actual y value to get the error.

Square the error (to keep it positive).

Sum all those squared errors — this is the total prediction error.

Separately, calculate how far each actual y value is from the average y (the variance of the data).

R² = 1 minus the ratio of prediction error to variance.

👉 The closer R² is to 1, the better the trend line explains the real data.
👉 If R² is near 0 or negative, the line doesn't explain much.
