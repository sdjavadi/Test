Hi Team,

As we approach the September 19th deadline, I want to stress how critical it is that we all stay fully responsive and aligned. Our front-end and business teams are making every effort to hit the target, but without timely support and responses from back-end, much of this work risks being stalled.

We need your quick feedback and active collaboration on open items over the next few days. Any delays now could compromise the entire delivery. Please treat all related requests as top priority until we cross the deadline.

Let’s keep communication tight and move fast—our collective effort will determine if we succeed.

Thanks for pushing with us on this,
