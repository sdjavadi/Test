Got it! Here's a **high-level logic description** your development team can use to understand and implement the monthly regression API for a single customer — **no code or SQL** involved.

## 📈 High-Level Logic for Monthly Regression API (Per Customer)

### 1. **Goal**

Identify whether a customer is showing a consistent upward or downward trend in their financial activity (e.g., transaction volume or count) over time by fitting a **linear trend line** to their monthly data.

---

### 2. **Data Inputs**

* A time range: `start_date` to `end_date`
* A single customer ID
* A set of numeric metrics (e.g., incoming amount, outgoing count)

---

### 3. **Monthly Aggregation**

* Group the customer’s transaction data into **monthly buckets**
* For each month, calculate total values for the selected metrics
* Result: A time series of one value per month per metric

---

### 4. **Trend Analysis (Regression)**

* For each metric:

  * Use the sequence of monthly values to fit a **straight line** (linear regression)
  * The slope tells whether the metric is **increasing**, **decreasing**, or **flat**
  * The R² score shows how consistent the trend is (how well the data fits the line)

---

### 5. **Missing Data Handling**

* If a month has no activity, optionally treat it as zero (configurable)
* If there are too few months of data or the values don’t vary, skip regression

---

### 6. **Output**

* For each metric, return:

  * **Slope** (positive = increasing trend, negative = decreasing)
  * **Intercept** (starting point of the trend line)
  * **R² Score** (how strong or reliable the trend is)
* If not enough data, return null values

---

### 7. **Use Case**

This logic helps analysts or systems detect:

* Customers with growing payment behavior (e.g., growing ACH volume)
* Sudden drop-offs in transaction activity
* Candidates for tier upgrades or risk review

Here’s a clear and concise explanation of how **slope**, **intercept**, and **R² (R-squared)** are calculated in the context of **linear regression**, using time-series data like monthly transaction values.

## 📐 What We're Doing

We’re fitting a **straight line** through a sequence of monthly values (e.g., total transaction amount per month for a customer), to capture the **trend**.

The equation of the line is:

$$
\hat{y} = \text{slope} \times x + \text{intercept}
$$

Where:

* $x$: time index (e.g., 0 for Jan, 1 for Feb, …)
* $y$: metric value in that month (e.g., total ACH credit amount)
* $\hat{y}$: predicted value from the line

---

## 1. 🔼 **Slope (Rate of Change)**

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

This measures **how much the metric changes per month**:

* Positive slope → increasing trend
* Negative slope → decreasing trend
* Zero slope → flat line

---

## 2. 🚦 **Intercept (Starting Point)**

$$
\text{intercept} = \bar{y} - \text{slope} \cdot \bar{x}
$$

This is the **predicted metric value at time zero**, i.e., where the trend line starts (theoretical value at month 0).

---

## 3. 📏 **R² Score (Goodness of Fit)**

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

This measures **how well the line fits the actual data**:

* $R^2 = 1$: perfect fit (all points lie on the line)
* $R^2 = 0$: no better than a flat average
* $R^2 < 0$: worse than a flat line (rare in clean data)

## 🧠 Intuition

| Value     | Meaning                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slope     | How fast and in what direction the metric is changing monthly |
| Intercept | What the metric would be at the beginning (month 0)           |
| R² Score  | How reliable that trend is (does the line match reality?)     |

---

## Example

Let’s say a customer’s monthly debit amounts are:

| Month | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Jan   | 1000  |
| Feb   | 1100  |
| Mar   | 1250  |
| Apr   | 1400  |

* The **slope** would be \~133 → customer increases \~\$133 per month
* The **intercept** might be \~900 → their predicted baseline at month zero
* The **R²** would be close to 1 → strong, consistent increase
